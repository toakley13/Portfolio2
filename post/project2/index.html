<ul>
<li>In this project we will construct a formula in which we predict which current minor league players will have future success. We will use older data to see how well our formula does.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="collecting-the-data">Collecting the Data</h2>
<p>For this project, we took data from two different sources for the purpose of discovering how well our formula did in two different circumstances. For the first dataset, 2012, we chose the top 20 prospects for each team as listed on MLB.com for that year. The second dataset, 2013, was taken from the list of every qualified minor league player (minimum 149 PA for batters and minimum 45.1 IP for pitchers) on Fangraphs for that year. In total, the 2012 dataset had 600 data points (320 batters and 280 pitchers) and the 2013 dataset had 1,996 data points (1,393 batters and 603 pitchers).</p>
<p>We decided upon using these two separate dataset sources because the 2012 dataset would allow us to test our formula on comparing highly-ranked prospects to see where top prospects bust. Alternatively, the 2013 dataset would allow us to test our formula on all prospects, giving us the opportunity to see where unsung prospects turned All-Stars might come from as well as comparing the top-ranked prospects’ stats to those of average prospects.</p>
<p>Since we scraped the data directly from Fangraphs, which has fully complete databases in .csv form separated by whether or not the player was a batter or a pitcher, we didn’t need to remove any data points from the datasets due to incomplete data. However, when looking through the datasets, we found that two categories were repeated for the hitters. After this cleaning, we were left with 51 variables for hitters and 53 for pitchers.</p>
<p>Then, using the pandas library in Python, we randomly selected 75 players from each of the four categories (2012 hitters, 2012 pitchers, 2013 hitters, 2013 pitchers) in order to be our testing datasets with regards to how accurate our formulas were. This also ensured we would most likely not be getting only now-established major leaguers or only prospects who never made the MLB.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>At this point, we only had statistics for these players along with their name, team, and age. We decided that, while those statistics would be helpful enough to create our formula with, we needed some other information in order to judge the accuracy of our formula. The variables that we collected for each of the 75 players we randomly selected in each category were the highest level they played at, whether or not they ever made the MLB, whether or not they played in foreign leagues, how many MLB games they had played as of the end of the 2020 season, their career earnings, and their position. In the end, we found that position and number of MLB appearances ended up being the most helpful in evaluating the relative quality of each player.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-formula">Creating the Formula</h2>
<p>When we began working on determining the statistics we wanted to use for hitters, we wanted to find statistics that were general enough that they could be applied to mostly any type of player since things like home runs aren’t fair to small ball players who drive in runs consistently with small hits as well as the alternative of OBP not being fair to players who mostly either strikeout, walk, or hit a home run. One stat we found that fit this perfectly were wOBA (Weighted On-Base Average) which “is a rate statistic which attempts to credit a hitter for the value of each outcome (single, double, etc.) rather than treating all hits or times on base equally.”1​ ​ The other statistic we decided to use was wRC+ (Weighted Runs Created Plus) which “is a rate statistic which attempts to credit a hitter for the value of each outcome (single, double, etc.) rather than treating all hits or times on base equally, while also controlling for park effects and the current run environment.”2​ ​ Other variables we considered but didn’t use were BABIP, which would have adjusted for how well a player beats fielding formations and Spd, which would have allowed us to give more credit to players who mainly were prized for their speed.</p>
<p>What we decided to do was, as seen below, was to compare each players’ wOBA and wRC+ compared to their respective averages and then take the mean of how much better or worse they performed than said averages. For 2012, the MLB average wOBA used was .315 and in 2013, it was .314. wRC+ as a statistic is formatted in such a way that a wRC+ value of 100 will always be the average.</p>
<p>For the pitchers, we took a similar mindset. The primary stat that we found that was the most generalized over all environments was xFIP (Expected Fielding Independent Pitching). xFIP “is a statistic that estimates a pitcher’s expected run prevention independent of the performance of their defense.”3​ ​ There didn’t seem to be any other stats that were a catch-all like xFIP, but we noticed that strikeouts are highly valued and sought after in today’s MLB. Thus, we decided that K/9, or the amount of strikeouts the pitcher would get in an average 9 innings game, would be a good complement to xFIP. It is also a good statistic to use because it doesn’t involve the fielders behind the pitchers at all. It just mainly focuses on the pitcher and the hitter, limiting other outside variables.</p>
<p>We decided to do the same thing that we did for the batters and compared the players’ xFIP and K/9 and compare them to the MLB league averages. In 2012, the average xFIP was 4.01 and the average K/9 was 7.56. For 2013, however, the average xFIP went down to 3.87 and the average K/9 stayed mostly the same at 7.57. For xFIP, the reason we have the calculation for the averages reversed is due to the fact that, in contrast to the rest of the statistics, a lower xFIP value is favorable.</p>
<p>Both equations, as seen below, were created in such a way that they are normalized around an average score of 1, based on the average values we found and utilized. If a player, for example, received a score of 1.35, that would mean their score was 35% higher than average. Conversely, a player who scored a 0.87 scored 13% below the average.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>In conclusion, we found our formulas quite useful. When ranking our 2012 and 2013 data sets it tended to show players with longer MLB careers, than of those towards the bottom of our rankings. In our statistics summary for both hitters and pitchers, you can see that the 2012 players tended to have longer MLB careers than those of the 2013 data sets. This is as expected as 2012 was a list of every team&rsquo;s Top 20 Prospects, where 2013 included all prospects. Another important stat to look at is our median. Above the 50% mark indicates our formula projects them to have a higher chance at obtaining an MLB career in some form. While our fielder and pitcher formula does not with certainty project every player&rsquo;s future MLB career, it gives us a strong idea on what type of players we believe have a shot at making it there. Towards the top of the pitchers groups, we can see All-Stars like Michael Wacha and Noah Syndergaard as well as Domingo German who led the MLB in W/L% in 2019. On the hitters side of things, Khris Davis, who led the MLB in HR in 2018, has the most points. All-Stars like Tommy La Stella and Xander Bogaerts also rank towards the top of their respective lists.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t to say that our model is perfect. Obviously, the first thing that can be fixed is to refine our model to make it work even better. Beyond that, however, there are some things that are impossible to account for with the available statistics. Chris Volstad ranks so low despite having so much experience because his 2013 stats came after the majority of his MLB games were played. This, and in a few other cases, are because the 2013 dataset was not just limited to prospects. In addition, high-paid hitters like J.T. Realmuto rank low because they are catchers  who are generally more prized for their arms and catching ability than their bats. Similarly, players like Terrance Gore make their money from their speed. Some successful pitchers and hitters rank low because the minor leagues are also a place of adjustment. Many players reach new heights in their abilities after changing their playing style. Some hitters change their batting stance and some pitchers learn a new pitch or change their arm slots while working their way up through the minors, which would explain how they have been so successful without having a good score. Conversely, some of the higher ranked players fail to reach the majors due to unforeseen circumstances such as a career-ending injury or difficulty returning from Tommy John surgery.</p>
